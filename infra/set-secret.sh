# Puts a secret value into Secret Manager, or rotates one already there.

#   ./infra/set-secret.sh staging openai-api-key      prompts, hidden

#
# This is the one way a key enters this system. There is deliberately no other:
#
#   - Secret Manager is the single source of truth for staging and prod. The
#     repo has never held a credential and must not start; a .env file holds
#     local development values only, and is gitignored.
#   - The value is NEVER a command-line argument. Arguments land in shell
#     history, in `ps` output, and in any process listing a colleague can read.
#     It arrives on stdin or from a hidden prompt, and is unset on the way out.
#   - Every secret is per environment, so staging and prod cannot share a key by
#     accident: the name is always <env>-<what>.
#   - Access is granted to the environment's runtime service account and to
#     nothing else, per secret. app-staging cannot read prod's anything.
#
# Rotation is the same command. Secret Manager versions the value, so a new
# version supersedes the old without deleting it, and rolling back is adding the
# previous value again. What this script cannot do is push the new value into a
# running service -- see the note it prints when it finishes.

cat <<NOTE

A running revision keeps the value it started with.
Cloud Run resolves :latest when an instance starts, not when a version is added,
so a rotation reaches the service only when a new revision rolls. Either:

  merge anything to main            (staging redeploys, picks up the new value)
  gcloud run services update dona-$ENV --region $REGION --project $PROJECT \\
    --update-env-vars ROTATED_AT=\$(date +%s)

The second rolls a revision without a code change. Verify with the boot line in
the logs, which names what the service actually resolved.
NOTE
