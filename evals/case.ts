// The shape of one golden case, and of one answer from whatever is being
// graded. Assertions are on behaviour -- which tool ran, was a clause cited,
// was the answer refused -- not on final-text equality, so cases survive the
// agent's wording changing (docs/pipeline.md §7).
//
// There are three kinds of case, and a file is exactly one of them:
//
//   - a **behavioural** case, carrying `expect`, graded against an agent turn;
//   - a **retrieval** case, carrying `retrieval`, graded against the ordered
//     result set a question returns;
//   - a **grounding** case, carrying `grounding`, graded against what the
//     question may be answered *from* -- the lease, the company's policy, or
//     nothing at all.
//
// The second kind exists because ranking is a measured defect rather than a
// suspicion, and a defect with no instrument is a feeling. The third exists
// because a refusal is not observable in a rank: a question can retrieve eight
// clauses and still have no answer.
//
// Lifted from v3 (docs/from-v3.md Tier 1), renaming nothing.
